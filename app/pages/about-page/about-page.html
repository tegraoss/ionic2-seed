  <p>
    Ionic was founded in 2012, when using web technologies as a means to build native apps was still in its infancy. When we started, we just wanted to create a better way for web developers to use their existing skillsets to build apps for the app stores.

    Today, Ionic is the world's most popular cross-platform mobile development technology stack, powering fast growing startups to some of the biggest companies in the world.

  <p>
    Millions of developers from nearly every industry around the world have built millions of mobile apps with Ionic. Our Framework and Platform allow developers to use web technologies to build high quality hybrid mobile apps, and then scale those apps simply with services like user auth, push notifications, live deployments, and more.

    Ionic not only makes app development easier, faster, and more accessible—it makes it more fun. Mobile is all about finding new ways to change the way humans interact with the world, and we couldn’t think of anything more fun than that.
